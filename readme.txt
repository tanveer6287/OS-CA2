Design a scheduler with multilevel queue having two queues which will schedule the processes on the basis of  pre-emptive shortest remaining processing time first algorithm (SROT) followed by a scheduling in which each process will get 2 units of time to execute. Also note that queue 1 has higher priority than queue 2.  
Calculate the average turnaround time and average waiting time for each process. The input for number of processes and their arrival time, burst time should be given by the user.
